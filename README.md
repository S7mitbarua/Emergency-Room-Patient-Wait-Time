# Emergency Room Wait Time Analysis
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing emergency room (ER) wait times across different hours of the day and days of the week. By using computer-generated simulated patient data, the primary objective is to pinpoint peak times of activity in the ER, offering valuable insights for effective resource allocation and management.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platform:** Google Colab

## Project Steps
- **Generate Simulated Data:** Simulate patient data using NumPy to mimic ER wait times for various hours over a span of days.
- **Install Required Libraries:** Make sure to have essential libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn installed in the Google Colab environment.
- **Visualize Data Using Line Chart:** Utilize Matplotlib to create a line chart displaying average wait times, aiding in the identification of patterns and peak hours.
- **Interpretation:** Analyze the chart to identify trends, helping with resource planning and enhancing patient experiences during busier periods.

## Expected Outcome
- Identification of peak hours with elevated average wait times.
- Insights into wait time variations throughout the week.
- A visual representation of ER activity patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time data sources for live monitoring.
- Implementation of predictive analytics for forecasting busy periods.
- Collaboration with healthcare professionals for more in-depth analysis.
